## Research Area

This research focuses on the development of **interpretable and clinically applicable machine learning models** to predict **recurrence and survival outcomes** in breast cancer patients across multiple time horizons (2, 5, and 10 years).

The models are designed according to **TRIPOD** reporting guidelines and integrate clinical and hematological data to enhance prognostic accuracy. In this final module, the project completes the **multi-horizon framework** analysis, finalizes the manuscript for submission to *npj Breast Cancer (Nature)*, and prepares for international publication and academic career advancement.

## Overview of Sprints

### Sprint 1 – October 13 to 24, 2025
**Main Objective:** Deliver the complete restructuring of notebooks by tumor subtype.

**Activities:**
- Reorganization of notebooks into three main groups:
  - Data analysis (exploratory and descriptive);
  - Predictive modeling (ML and performance analyses);
  - Metrics evaluation and visualization.
- Standardization of headers, cells, and results sections.
- Correction of paths and internal documentation for future replication.
- Insertion of new figures in the article (ROC curves, Kaplan-Meier, feature importance, etc.) with revised captions.

**Deliverables:**
- Restructured and versioned notebooks in the GitHub repository.
- Updated figures integrated into the article (partial version).
- Descriptive GitHub README explaining the restructuring (explaining the new division and analysis flows).

**Note:** This restructuring marks the formal delivery of Sprint 1.

### Sprint 2 – October 27 to November 7, 2025
**Main Objective:** Update results and consolidate the Results section in the article.

**Activities:**
- Insertion of final metrics obtained in the notebooks (by tumor subtype).
- Textual review of the manuscript's results section.
- Adjustment and standardization of captions, tables, and figures.
- First structural review of the Discussion section (based on new findings).

**Deliverables:**
- Updated article version with complete figures and consolidated results.
- Final metrics tables by tumor subtype.

### Sprint 3 – November 10 to 21, 2025
**Main Objective:** Finalize the Discussion, consolidate the manuscript, and deliver the TCC presentation.

**Activities:**
- Complete rewriting of the Discussion section, highlighting the comparison of results between subtypes (HR+, HER2+, TNBC).
- Integration of updated references and formatting review according to TRIPOD guidelines.
- Creation of final slides for the TCC defense.
- Presentation rehearsal with supervisors and adjustments of time and content.

**Deliverables:**

### Sprint 4 – November 24 to December 5, 2025
**Main Objective:** Structured initiation of the international application process and linguistic preparation for TOEFL.

**Activities:**
- Completion of a diagnostic TOEFL mock test, identifying strengths and weaknesses in the four main areas (reading, listening, speaking, and writing).
- Definition of score goals and creation of a personalized study plan with digital resources (Magoosh, ETS, academic YouTube, and free practice materials).
- Organization of essential academic documents for future applications (academic transcript, certificates, diploma, recommendation letter template).
- Initial update of the international academic curriculum, highlighting the TCC project, data science skills, and collaboration with research institutions.
- Creation of an application tracking folder, containing document checklist and preparation status.
- Initial structuring of a recommendation letter template, for future customization according to chosen programs.
- Review and update of online academic profiles (LinkedIn, ORCID, and ResearchGate) with project summary and obtained results.
- Light reading of essay and personal statement models for familiarization with the format expected by foreign universities.

**Deliverables:**
- TOEFL study plan with performance goals and practice schedule.
- Updated international academic curriculum.
- Organized digital folder of documents for applications.
- Preliminary templates for recommendation letter and personal statement.
- Reviewed and updated academic profiles.

### Sprint 5 – December 8 to 19, 2025
**Main Objective:** Consolidate the international application process and finalize post-TCC academic documentation.

**Activities:**
- Writing and initial review of the personal statement and statement of purpose, focusing on the research line in machine learning and oncology.
- Detailed research and selection of universities, potential supervisors, and postgraduate scholarships compatible with the developed project.
- Mapping of deadlines and elaboration of an application tracking spreadsheet (deadlines, documents, letters, status).
- Review and standardization of the academic curriculum (international CV) in the format required by each institution (e.g., Europass, American format).
- Continuity of the TOEFL study plan, with specific practices of writing and speaking (short mock tests and thematic essays).
- Update of the online academic profile (LinkedIn, ResearchGate, or ORCID) with the TCC, publication, and project results.
- Organization of a digital application folder, containing transcript, certificates, letters, articles, and summaries ready for submission.
- Creation of a one-page scientific summary of the TCC for attachment in applications and scholarship submissions.
- Reflective record of competencies developed during the project (in learning journal or retrospective report format).

**Deliverables:**
